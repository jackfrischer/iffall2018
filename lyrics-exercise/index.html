		Oh oh oh <br>
		Oh oh oh
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Verse 1]</strong> <br>
		Pick apart every piece of me <br>
		And miss the point entirely <br>
		I only did this to be sane <br>
		Not for you to know my name <br>
		Go 'head and spit the music out <br>
		Please tell me more about your doubt <br>
		Don't fear, I've heard it all before <br>
		Each time makes it easier to ignore 
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
		Oh, I am tired of abiding by your rules<br>
		Causing me to second guess my every single move<br>
		You don't know who I am<br>
		Or what I have been through, no<br>
		So don't dare tell me what I should and shouldn't do 'cause...<br>

	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Chorus]</strong><br>
		Not here to lose<br>
		Not here for you to choose how we, should be<br>
		Cause we're not part of your machine<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine, no<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Verse 2]</strong><br>
		Dont feel like having a computer sing this phrase<br>
		Not looking for a hired name to write a song for me that sounds the same<br>
		As everything fed to our brain's rammed down our throats with no complaints<br>
		Maybe I'm a dying breed, but I believe in individuality<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
		Oh, I am tired of abiding by these rules<br>
		Causing me to second guess my every single move<br>
		You dont know who I am<br>
		Or wha I have been through, no<br>
		So don't dare tell me what I should and shouldn't do 'cause...<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Chorus]</strong><br>
		Not here to lose<br>
		Not here for you to choose how we, should be<br>
		Cause were not part of your machine<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine, no<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Bridge]</strong><br>
		(Hey, hey)<br>
		Told to look an act a way, as if I'm just a ball of clay<br>
		That you can just mold into whatever, I assure you thats not clever<br>
		See now fads don't last forever; they are fleeting like the weather<br>
		And we will stand our ground while you will sink and drown<br>
		Hahaha!<br>
		Cause I'm a tough girl, I run my own world<br>
		And if you dont like it, there's the door<br>
		If you haven't heard, I ain't got no interest in your business<br>
		Just here for the music and there's nothing else to this bullshit!<br>
		Woah-oh-oh oh cause...<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong class="lyric-type">[Chorus]</strong><br>
		Not here to lose<br>
		Not here for you to choose how we, should be<br>
		Cause we're not part of your mach<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine<br>
		We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine, no<br>
