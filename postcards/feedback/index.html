	<h1>Aesthetic</h1>
<li>Good Typeface</li>
<li>Clear and Legible</li>
<li>Imagery works well with the text overall, but the change in photo from mobile to web is a little off-putting.</li>
<li>If you want the photos to change from mobile to web, then that should appy to all three quotes. In your mockups, two change photos when one does not.</li>
<li>Really enjoy the change in text color</li>
<li>Please don’t squeeze text like in “You fit me . . .” (it upsets the type gods)</li>
<li>Aesthetic throughout is clear and successful</li>
<li>Prefer when Lana Del Rey is on one line</li>
<li>Aesthetic is consistent, but try using the same color text for each quote (black, blue, pink)</li>
<li> Not sure if the Lana picture for "You fit me better . . " relates</li>


	<h1>Structure</h1>

<li>Try to make sure the tone of the images match the quote on both phone and web (for example: the “We’re the masters . . ." image is black and white on mobile and color on web. This creates confusion and takes away from being cohesive.</li>
<li>Make sure you use the same 3 quotes (pictures can change as long as they match the theme and feel cohesive)</li>
<li>Use one form of justification (Left/right/center) You have one that uses left when the others are all center.</li>

	<h1>Technical Challenges</h1>

<li>Check the quality of images (first image looks pixelated)</li>
<li>See how text could interact with imagery (it will need to touch Lana at some point)</li>
<li>Make sure the text color contrasts enough over Lana when acting responsive</li>
